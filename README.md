# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (C++): 
1. Bubble Sort:
   - Least efficient algorithm
   - makes O(n^2) comparisions worst case 
3. Selection Sort
   - Algorithm works by continuously finding the max element each iteration. This ultimately sorts the array. 
   - makes O(n^2) comparisions worst case  
5. Insertion Sort
   - Similar to sorting playing cards in your hand
   - makes O(n^2) comparisions worst case
7. Quick Sort
   - most efficient out of those listed here
   - makes O(n log n) comparisions
   - Divide and conquer algorithm
   - Linearathmic (linear plus logarithmic) 
9. Merge Sort
   - Efficient sorting algorithm
   - makes O(n log n) comparisions
   - Divide and conquer algorithm
   - Linearmathic (linear plus logarithmic)
     
This program contains these sorting algorithms and uses each of them to sort a randomly assigned array/vector of size n. The program then displays the time taken to 
sort each of those arrays/vectors to the console.

## How to run: 
- compile with g++

## Technologies 
- C++
- standard C++ template library (STL)
