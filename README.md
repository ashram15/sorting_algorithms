# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (C++): 

## Overview:
This project implements and analyzes five common sorting algorithms in C++. It is also designed to benchmark their performances by sorting a large, randomly, generated vector and timing how long each algorithm takes to complete the sort. This serves as a visualization of each algorithm's time complexity. 

## Algorithms: 
**1. Bubble Sort**:
   - Simplest Sorting algorithm; works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. 
   - Time Complexity: `$O(n^2)$` 
**2. Selection Sort**:
   - Algorithm works by continuously finding the max element each iteration. This ultimately sorts the array. 
   - Time Complexity: `$O(n^2)$`  
**3. Insertion Sort**:
   - Similar to sorting playing cards in your hand
   - makes O(n^2) comparisions worst case
4. Quick Sort
   - most efficient out of those listed here
   - makes O(n log n) comparisions
   - Divide and conquer algorithm
   - Linearathmic (linear plus logarithmic) 
5. Merge Sort
   - Efficient sorting algorithm
   - makes O(n log n) comparisions
   - Divide and conquer algorithm
   - Linearmathic (linear plus logarithmic)
     
This program contains these sorting algorithms and uses each of them to sort a randomly assigned array/vector of size n. The program then displays the time taken to 
sort each of those arrays/vectors to the console.

## How to run: 
- compile with g++
